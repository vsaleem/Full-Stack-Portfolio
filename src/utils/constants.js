		INTRO: `Hi! My name is Vic, a remote Frontend Web Developer residing in
    Dallas, TX, and I absolutely love building beautiful and
    functional websites. With multiple years of experience working
    with React and Redux, I've become an expert in creating dynamic
    and responsive user interfaces that provide seamless user
    experiences.`,
		BODY: `I pride myself on my attention to detail and my
    ability to bring my clients' visions to life. Whether I'm
    working on a brand new project or improving an existing one, I'm
    passionate about finding creative solutions to complex problems.
    When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying some retail
    therapy at my favorite boutique, sipping on a cup of matcha tea
    while reading up on the latest, best coding practices, or
    spending time teaching my beloved dog to have quiet time during Team meetings. `,
		CONCLUSION: `I may not have a water cooler to gather around with my
    team, but I have a tea pot that never runs dry, which is
    basically the same thing, right? 

    I'm always eager to collaborate
    with like-minded individuals and take on new challenges, so
    please don't hesitate to reach out if you think we could work
    together!`,
